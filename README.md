# Fractured Reality

## About

Fractured Reality is an exploration game like no other.

See the landing page on the `gh-pages` branch, or
[live on the web][1].

## Development

The build system is based on [Stylus][2] for stylesheets and
[Browserify][3] for JS, all orchestrated using [Gulp][4]. Requires
[Node.js][5].

To spin up a local instance for development:

    git clone https://github.com/strugee/fractured-reality
    cd fractured-reality
    npm install
    # If you don't already have a global `gulp`
    npm install -g gulp
    gulp serve
